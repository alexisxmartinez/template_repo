## II. Data Exploration & Preparation

*   [ ] **Data Understanding:**
    *   [ ] Load the data into a suitable format (e.g., pandas DataFrame).
    *   [ ] Explore the data with summary statistics and descriptive analysis.
    *   [ ] Identify the features and target variables in your data.
    *   [ ] Check for missing values, outliers, and data quality issues.

    *   [ ] Handle outliers (removal, transformation, etc.).
    *   [ ] Convert data types to be suitable for analysis and modeling.
    *   [ ] Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.).
    *   [ ] Scale and/or normalize numerical features if needed (standard scaling, min-max scaling).
    *   [ ] Split the data into training, validation, and test sets (when needed for modeling).
*   [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   [ ] Perform visualization to understand feature distributions and relationships.
    *   [ ] Identify any significant patterns or correlations.
