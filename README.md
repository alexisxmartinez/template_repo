    *   Use diagrams or bullet points to present the different steps that you have taken.
*   **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Outline what type of cleaning process you have used, such as null value handling, duplicate removal, type corrections, or string transformations.
    *  Justify why you have performed each of these steps, and explain why they are needed.
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Describe the types of feature engineering that you have performed, such as:
        *   Categorical feature encoding (e.g., Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding).
        *   Numerical feature scaling (e.g., standardization, normalization).
        *   Interaction term creation, and why you are choosing each of those approaches.
     * Clearly state what new features were created and why.
*   **Data Splitting:**
    *   Explain how you split your data, and what was the percentage of data that you used for each part, including training, validation and test.
    *  If you have used any specific approach for your splits, such as stratified splits or different methods to handle class imbalance, you should also document that.
*   **Modeling:**
    *   **Model Selection**: Explain why you selected the models you used.
    *   **Model Training:** Explain your training procedure, and include any key detail of what you did (such as hyperparameters tunning, or early stopping).
    *   **Evaluation**: How did you evaluate your model? What metrics are you using, and why?

* **Feature Analysis**:
    * If you used feature importances or any method to study what features are more important for the model, you should document that in this section.
*   **Results Analysis:**
    *   Summarize your key findings, including model performance, and analysis of the different plots and model results.
    *   Try to put everything together, and use all of the knowledge you gained to create insights that are useful.

## 5. Results

*   **Model Performance:** Present the results from your models, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any other metrics that are useful for your project. Use tables or bullet points to summarize the results of each model.
*   **Visualizations:** Include plots that support your findings, like distributions of the target variable, feature importances, or relationships between some important features.
* **Documentation of limitations:** Use this section to document any limitation of the approach, or problems that you were not able to fix during your work, and why.

## 6. Comparison with Previous Work

*   **Previous Approaches:** How did you use the work that was done by other people as a starting point for your project, or how your project was inspired by other projects.
*   **Novel Contributions:** How does your project enhance or differ from the previous work? What unique methods or findings are presented in your project?

## 7. Future Work

*   Identify what you would do differently if you had more time. What other models you could try, how would you approach your feature engineering, or what other types of analysis would you do if you had more resources.

## 8. Code and Environment

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   List all of the tools and frameworks used, and provide a method to install it. You can list your dependencies in this section or create a `requirements.txt` file.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   Explain how your code is organized (e.g., different notebooks, folders).
*  **Code Style** Use docstrings, comments and code formatting to ensure that your code is clean and well documented.

## 9. License

(Optional) Include a license if you want others to reuse your work, such as MIT or Apache.

## 10. References

List all your references using a citation style (like APA, MLA, etc.) that you prefer.

## 11. Contact
(Optional) Add your name and email, in case you want to be contacted for a specific reason.

**Checklist for Standard Documents and Practices (Python, SQL, Git):**

**I. Python**

*   **Code Style:**
    *   [ ] Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.
    *   [ ] Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
    *   [ ] Keep code lines reasonably short (e.g., under 100 characters).
*   **Modularity:**
    *   [ ] Break code into functions and classes.
    *   [ ] Minimize code duplication by re-using functions and classes.
    *   [ ] Use modules and imports to organize code.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Use comments to explain your code.
    *   [ ] Use docstrings to document the purpose, parameters, and return values of your functions and classes.
    * [ ] Use type hints on all of your functions, as well as all the variables.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   [ ] Use `try...except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
    *   [ ] Use specific Exception clauses.
*  **Data Operations:**
    * [ ] If using Pandas, prefer vectorized operations and avoid looping.
     * [ ] When using Pandas, fill `NaN` values before any other operation, using `fillna()`
    *  [ ] If doing a matrix transformation always ensure that you have non-duplicate names.

**II. SQL**

*   **Style:**
    *   [ ] Use uppercase for SQL keywords (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`).
    *   [ ] Use lowercase or snake_case for database objects (e.g., `table_name`, `column_name`).
    *   [ ] Use indentation and line breaks to improve readability.
*   **Comments:**
    *   [ ] Add comments to explain the SQL code.
    *   [ ] Document the purpose of queries, joins, or subqueries.
*   **Security:**
    *   [ ] Sanitize SQL queries before sending them to the database.
    *   [ ] Handle user inputs securely.
*   **Efficiency:**
    *   [ ] Use indexes to optimize queries.
    *   [ ] Use `LIMIT` clauses to prevent full table scans.

**III. Git**

*   **Repository:**
    *   [ ] Create a well-structured and organized repository.
    *   [ ] Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project.
*   **Commits:**
    *   [ ] Write descriptive commit messages using the imperative mood.
    *   [ ] Commit small, logical chunks of work.
    *   [ ] Avoid large or messy commits.
*   **Branches:**
    *   [ ] Use branches for different features or tasks, and then merge them to the `main` branch.
    *   [ ] Do not work directly on your `main` branch.
*   **Pull Requests:**
    *   [ ] Use pull requests for code reviews (if you are working with a team).
*   **`.gitignore`:**
    *   [ ] Use a `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., data files, virtual environments, etc).

**How to Use This Checklist:**

1.  **Copy and Paste:** Use the `README.md` as a template and fill the details of your own project.
2.  **Check Off Items:** As you work on each project, use this checklist and tick off the boxes as you fulfill each of the requirements.
3.  **Iterate:** Continuously improve your coding practices and project documentation based on this checklist.
